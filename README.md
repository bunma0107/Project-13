Introducing Dynamic Assignment Into Our structure.
In your https://github.com/<your-name>/ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository start a new branch and call it dynamic-assignments.

Create a new folder, name it dynamic-assignments. Then inside this folder, create a new file and name it env-vars.yml. We will instruct site.yml to include this playbook later. For now, let us keep building up the structure.
